Manual Installation Instructions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

These installation instructions assume that you have Ubercart installed, configured, and working
correctly.

1. Extract the module archive into a temporary location.

2. Copy the entire "uc_agms" module folder into drupal/sites/all/modules/
	
3. Enable the payment module in Ubercart's Administer -> Site Building -> Modules

4. Configure the module in Ubercart's Administer -> Store administration -> Configuration -> Payment Settings -> Payment Gateways

5. Configure the Credit Cards module in Ubercart's Administer -> Store administration -> Configuration -> Payment Settings -> Payment Methods -> Credit Card.
	5.1. Update the available credit cards to those supported by the AGMS Gateway:
		Visa
		MasterCard
		Discover
		American Express
		Diners Club
		JCB
	5.2. Set AGMS Gateway as the default payment gateway

6. Run a test transaction for a small amount to ensure everything is working
correctly.



Authorization
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In Authorization mode, the customer's card is not immediately charged, but is charged later when the store owner captures the sale.

In order to initiate the capture, use the credit card terminal in Ubercart:

	- Navigate to Administer -> Store administration -> Orders -> Order -> Process card
	
	- Select Authorization
	
	- Edit the amount in "Charge Amount" as required. It can be any value up to the amount Authorized.
		
	- Click "Capture amount to this authorization"
	
A capture transaction can only be submitted once. Be sure to double check the details before
clicking "Capture."
	
Alternatively, if you no longer require an authorization, you can remove it by clicking the "Void authorization" button. This will not issue a transaction in the AGMS Gateway, and the transaction record in Ubercart's database will be deleted.



Refunds
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To issue a refund from the credit card terminal (order -> process card):

	- Enter the amount to refund in "Charge Amount"
	
	- Click "Credit amount to this card"
	
The refund will be issued against the last successful payment. If you need to issue a refund
against a different payment, use login to the AGMS Gateway at https://gateway.agms.com/
