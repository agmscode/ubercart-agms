Manual Installation Instructions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

These installation instructions assume that you have Ubercart installed, configured and working
correctly.

1. Extract the module archive into a temporary location.

2. Copy the entire module folder (uc_agms) into drupal/sites/all/modules/
	
3. Enable the module via Administer->Site Building->Modules

4. Configure the module via Administer->Store administration->Configuration->Payment Settings
->Payment Gateways

5. Configure the Credit Cards module via Administer->Store administration->Configuration->
Payment Settings->Payment Methods->Credit Card.
	-Update the available credit cards to those supported by Agms Payment Gateway:
		Visa
		Mastercard
		American Express
		Diners Club
		JCB
	-Set "Agms Payment Gateway" as the default payment gateway

6. Run some test transactions to ensure everything is working
correctly with test credit card.



Preauthorisation
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In Preauthorisation mode, the customer's card is not immediately charged, but is charged later after the store owner confirms the payment.

In order to issue the capture, use the credit-card terminal:

	-Go to Administer->Store administration->Orders->Order->Process card
	
	-Select the Authorisation
	
	-Edit the amount in "Charge Amount" as required. It can be any value up to the Authorisation
		amount.
		
	-Click "Capture amount to this authorisation"
	
As an Capture transaction can only be submitted once, be sure to double-check the details before
clicking "Capture".
	
Alternatively, if you no longer require a preauthorisation, you can remove it with the "Void authorisation" button. This will not issue a gateway transaction, instead the transaction record in Ubercart's database will be deleted.



Refunds
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To issue a refund from the credit-card terminal (order->process card):

	-Enter the amount to refund in "Charge Amount"
	
	-Click "Credit amount to this card"
	
And the refund will be issued against the last successful payment. If you need to issue a refund
against a different payment, use the SecurePay merchant login.




Test Gateway Operation
-------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no seperate test gateway, the transaction are treated in test mode using the test card data.
