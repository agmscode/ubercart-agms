-------------------------------------------------------------------

uc_recurring 2.x - http://drupal.org/project/uc_recurring
	(optional: required for recurring payments)



Manual Installation Instructions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

These installation instructions assume that you have Ubercart installed, configured and working
correctly.

1. Extract the module archive into a temporary location.

2. Copy the entire module folder (uc_securepayxml) into drupal/sites/all/modules/
	
3. Enable the module via Administer->Site Building->Modules

4. Configure the module via Administer->Store administration->Configuration->Payment Settings
->Payment Gateways

5. Configure the Credit Cards module via Administer->Store administration->Configuration->
Payment Settings->Payment Methods->Credit Card.
	-Update the available credit cards to those supported by SecurePay:
		Visa
		Mastercard
		American Express
		Diners Club
		JCB
	-Set "SecurePay XML API (AU)" as the default payment gateway

6. With the module in "Test" mode, run some test transactions to ensure everything is working
correctly.



Preauthorisation & Advice
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In Preauthorisation mode, the customer's card is not immediately charged, but is charged later
after the store owner confirms the payment.

In order to issue the charge (an Advice transaction), use the credit-card terminal:

	-Go to Administer->Store administration->Orders->Order->Process card
	
	-Select the Authorisation
	
	-Edit the amount in "Charge Amount" as required. It can be any value up to the Authorisation
		amount.
		
	-Click "Capture amount to this authorisation"
	
As an Advice transaction can only be submitted once, be sure to double-check the details before
clicking "Capture".
	
Alternatively, if you no longer require a preauthorisation, you can remove it with the "Void 
authorisation" button. This will not issue a gateway transaction, instead the transaction record
in Ubercart's database will be deleted.



Refunds
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To issue a refund from the credit-card terminal (order->process card):

	-Enter the amount to refund in "Charge Amount"
	
	-Click "Credit amount to this card"
	
And the refund will be issued against the last successful payment. If you need to issue a refund
against a different payment, use the SecurePay merchant login.



Recurring Payments
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This module supports a kind of recurring payments via the uc_recurring module. Products can have
recurring fees associated with them, and the customer's account can be charged more than once 
according to a schedule without storing credit-card details.

Some things to note:

	-Recurring payments cannot be refunded from the admin interface (use the merchant login)
	
	-Recurring payments cannot be preauthorised, and the preauth setting is ignored.
	
	-The uc_recurring module version 2.x (which this module depends on for recurring payments) is
		still in the early stages of development, and is subject to change. Use it with care.



Test Gateway Operation
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If the "Test Mode" is selected, your transactions will be processed against the SecurePay Test 
Gateway. The Merchant ID and Transaction Password for the test gateway are NOT the same as the 
Merchant ID and Transaction Password for your live Merchant Account. Please contact your Securepay 
Payment Gateway Reseller or Securepay Support if you need a test Merchant ID and Transaction 
password.

If the transaction is would otherwise give a 000 "Approved" response code, the Test gateway will
return the cents portion of the transaction amount as the response code (i.e. transaction amount
of $1.05 will result in a "(05): Do Not Honour" response).

To achieve an "approved" test transaction, ensure the total transction amount (including tax and
shipping costs) is a round dollar value (i.e. $1.00)
